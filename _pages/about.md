ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Saran (Mighty) Burapachaisri! Currently a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, I love turning spontaneous ideas into products (just like this website)! I'm interested in developing user centered products ranging from iOS applications to assistive devices! Feel free to stroll around and connect if any of my works interests you. 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
